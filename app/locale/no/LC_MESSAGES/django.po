"      <h1>How It Works</h1>\n"
"      <p>Welcome to Exchangivist, the online portal giving users the ability "
"to connect with one another. Now that you’ve joined our community as an "
"Exchangivist, it’s very easy to get started.</p>\n"
"      <h4>Creating an offer to help:</h4>\n"
"\n"
"      <p>To offer your expertise, skills, or services, visit the ‘ Exchange’ "
"page and then click on the ‘Create an Offer’ button. Make sure to add a "
"title to your post that will tell users how you can help. Select as many "
"options as you feel you need from the drop down menu to make it easier for "
"other users to see what you are offering; the more detail you add the "
"better. This also helps Exchangivist find matches for its users.</p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4 >Requesting help:</h4>\n"
"      <p>To ask for help with expertise, skills or services, visit the "
"‘Exchange’ page, and then click on ‘Create a Request’ button. Make sure to "
"add a title to your post that will help users understand what you need. "
"Select as many options you feel you need from the drop down menu to make it "
"easier for users to understand your post; the more detail you can add the "
"better. This also helps Exchangivist find matches for its users.</p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Searching for offers or requests:</h4>\n"
"      <p>You can browse all ‘Offers’ and ‘Requests’ by visiting the "
"Exchange. Use the search bar to search for key-words or click ‘Show Filters’ "
"on the right-hand side of the page to filter posts based on country and "
"skills.</p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Replying to offers and requests:</h4>\n"
"      <p>To respond to an Offer or Request, click on the post you would like "
"to respond to and enter your comment below the post. To send a private "
"message to the Exchangivist who created the post, click on the three "
"horizontal bars at the top right of the post. The drop down menu also allows "
"you to recommend the post to another user, rate the user, or report an "
"abusive post.</p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Keeping up to date:</h4>\n"
"      <p>Exchangivist has been designed to make connecting easy, whenever "
"someone else responds to, comments on or adds a post relevant to you, the "
"notifications icon on the top of the page on the navigation bar will appear "
"highlighted in red, simply click on the notifications button to see the "
"latest notifications.</p>\n"

"        <h1>How It Works</h1>\n"
"        <h4>What is it?</h4>\n"
"        <p>Exchangivist is an online portal created to help make better in "
"the world. By allowing users to offer and request, help and services, giving "
"them the opportunity to connect with one another.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Why use it?</h4>\n"
"        <p>Exchangivist aims to make a difference in the darkest places on "
"earth, by connecting people who both need and want to offer help. Together "
"we can create better.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Creating a profile</h4>\n"
"        <p>To get started you will first need to sign up and create a "
"profile. Then you you will be asked to confirm your email address. As "
"Exchangivist is in closed beta, we will then confirm your information and "
"assign a rating based on the information provided to us. By vetting each "
"individual user, Exchangivist is able to protect our users and their "
"information.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Getting started & your privacy</h4>\n"
"        <p>As soon as you have an account you will be able to login and "
"finish creating your profile. Exchangivist users are able to choose what "
"they make public to the community, and each user can hide any, or all "
"information about themselves.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Creating offers and requests</h4>\n"
"        <p>Once you have completed your profile, you will be able to join "
"the Exchange  and start posting by either creating offers or requests. You "
"can create an offer or request using our tags and categories that make it "
"easier to find a match for your needs or skills.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Is this secure?</h4>\n"
"        <p>First, you should remember that no computer platform is 100%% "
"secure.  Please know that we have gone to great lengths to protect your "
"privacy and security.  We are working with some of the best experts in the "
"field who share and appreciate your concern for digital security.   However "
"it is always incumbent on you to be prudent about what information you share "
"on the Internet.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Can I remain anonymous?</h4>\n"
"        <p>Yes.  When you register you can create any screen name you like.  "
"We will never willingly share your identifying information with anyone.  If "
"you send a private message or post a comment only your screen name will be "
"shared with the recipient. </p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Are these people vetted?</h4>\n"
"        <p>We endeavor to check each request to join Exchangivist.  During "
"this limited beta test we know each member or a trusted colleague has "
"vouched for them.  If a member has 3 or more “AHR Stars” you can feel "
"confident that they can be trusted.  As the user base grows other members "
"will rate and vouch for other users.  You will be able to use this Community "
"Rating Stars as an additional source of confidence.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>About the Star Ratings</h4>\n"
"        <p>When a new Exchangivists joins the market we use the extent of "
"their digital presence to indicate a degree of confidence in who they are "
"and what they can do. If you sign up with just an email address you will be "
"given one star. The more information you provide—and we can verify – the "
"higher your AHR Star Rating.\n"
"        The Community Rating comes from other Exchangivist. Just like on "
"Amazon or Ebay as you interact with other users they will have the option of "
"expressing their confidence rating. To rate a member click on the STAR icon "
"in their Member card.\n"
"        You can request that your Rating be reviewed by sending an email to "
"Info@exchangivist.org</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>The country I want to deal with isn’t on the list.  / How do you "
"pick the countries on Exchangivist? </h4>\n"
"        <p>Freedom House has created a list of the Not Free and Partially "
"Free counties.  Of these we are currently supporting those with populations "
"over 10 million.  As Exchangivist expands we look forward to helping in "
"additional Not Free and Partially Free countries.  Given limited resources "
"we have chosen to focus on the largest dictatorships.  We focus on closed "
"societies because free and mostly free countries have alternates means of "
"addressing their human rights short comings.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>What am I allowed to post?</h4>\n"
"        <p>You may post anything that can reasonably be answered and "
"addresses a human rights abuse or short coming.  However you should remember "
"that Requests for advice, contacts, services, or knowledge are much more "
"readily supported than requests for equipment and other hardware that would "
"need to be shipped internationally or would involve import/export "
"restrictions in the effected countries.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Is anything off limits?</h4>\n"
"        <p>Anything that incites violence, hatred, religious intolerance, or "
"sectarian division.   At this time Exchangivist does not support requests "
"for donations or monetary transfers. </p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>How can I improve the response I get to a request or offer?</"
"h4>\n"
"        <p>Be as specific as possible.  If you need a camera indicate "
"whether you need a video or regular camera.  If you need a lawyer for an "
"asylum request are you hoping to request political asylum?  The more "
"specific you are the easier it will be for someone to know if and how they "
"can help.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <h4>Is the board moderated?</h4>\n"
"        <p>The Exchangivist reserves the right to delete any offending or "
"inappropriate posts.  In most cases we will attempt to contact the user "
"before removing a post but that may not always be feasible.\n"
"        In the event of duplicate posts we may merge or delete posts as "
"necessary.</p>\n"
