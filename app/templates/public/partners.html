        <span style="line-height: 18.9091px;">A World without Censorship (Un Mundo Sin Mordaza) is an international non-profit organization based in Venezuela, that promotes human rights and freedom of expression through the arts. We believe that art can help us unite and deliver progress on actual activism practices worldwide. Therefore, we offer global contests for citizens to express their artistic soul and also raise awareness to promote human rights' issues within the community.</span>
