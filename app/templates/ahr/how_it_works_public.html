        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <p>Movements is an online portal created to help make better in the world. By allowing users to offer and request, help and services, giving them the opportunity to connect with one another.</p>

        <h4>Why use it?</h4>
        <p>Movements aims to make a difference in the darkest places on earth, by connecting people who both need and want to offer help. Together we can create better.</p>

        <h4>Creating a profile</h4>
        <p>To get started you will first need to sign up and create a profile. Then you you will be asked to confirm your email address. As Movements is in closed beta, we will then confirm your information and assign a rating based on the information provided to us. By vetting each individual user, Movements is able to protect our users and their information.</p>

        <h4>Getting started & your privacy</h4>
        <p>As soon as you have an account you will be able to login and finish creating your profile. Movements users are able to choose what they make public to the community, and each user can hide any, or all information about themselves.</p>

        <h4>Creating offers and requests</h4>
        <p>Once you have completed your profile, you will be able to join the Exchange and start posting by either creating offers or requests. You can create an offer or request using our tags and categories that make it easier to find a match for your needs or skills.</p>

        <h4>Is this secure?</h4>
        <p>First of all, you should remember that no online platform is 100% secure. We have gone to great lengths to try and protect your personal privacy. We are working with some of the best experts in the field who share and appreciate your concern for digital security, however it is important to always stay safe online and only share personal information with people you trust.</p>

        <h4>Can I remain anonymous?</h4>
        <p>Yes. When you register you can create any username you like. We will never willingly share your identifying information with anyone. If you send a private message or post a comment only your username will be shared with the recipient. Make sure you don't use your real name as part of your username.</p>

        <h4>Are all users vetted?</h4>
        <p>We endeavor to check each request to join Movements. During this limited beta test we know each member or a trusted colleague has vouched for them. If a member has 3 or more “AHR Stars” you can feel confident that they can be trusted. As the user base grows other members will rate and vouch for other users. You will be able to use the Community Rating as an additional source of confidence.</p>

        <h4>How the AHR Star rating works</h4>
        <p>When a new Member joins the market, we review their digital presence as a means of confirming their identity, and providing confidence in who they are and what they do. If you sign up with just an email address you will be given one star. The more information you provide, and we can verify, the higher your AHR Star Rating.</p>
        
        <h4>How the Community Rating works</h4>
        <p>The Community Rating comes from other Members. Just like on Amazon or Ebay as you interact with other users they will have the option of expressing their confidence in you. To rate another Member, click on the STAR icon on their profile.</p>

        <h4>The country I want to deal with isn’t on the list/How do you pick the countries on Movements? </h4>
        <p>Freedom House has created a list of the "Not Free" and "Partially Free" counties. Of these we are currently supporting those with populations over 10 million. As Movements expands we look forward to helping in additional "Not Free" and "Partially Free" countries. Given limited resources we have chosen to focus on the largest dictatorships. We focus on closed societies because free, and mostly free countries have alternates means of addressing their human rights.</p>

        <h4>What am I allowed to post?</h4>
        <p>You may post anything that addresses a human rights abuse or short coming. Please keep in mind that requests for advice, contacts, services, or knowledge are more readily supported than requests for equipment and other hardware that would need to be shipped internationally or would involve import/export restrictions.</p>

        <h4>Is anything off limits?</h4>
        <p>Anything that incites violence, hatred, religious intolerance, or sectarian division. At this time Movements does not support requests for donations or monetary transfers. </p>

        <h4>How can I improve the responses I get to a request or offer?</h4>
        <p>Be as specific as possible. If you need a camera indicate whether you need a video or regular camera. If you need a lawyer for an asylum request, be clear what you are hoping to achieve. The more specific you are, the easier it will be for someone to know if and how they can help.</p>

        <h4>Is the board moderated?</h4>
        <p>The Movements admins reserves the right to delete any offending or inappropriate posts. In most cases we will attempt to contact the user before removing a post but that may not always be feasible. In the event of duplicate posts we may merge or delete posts as necessary.</p>
